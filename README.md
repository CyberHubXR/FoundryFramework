# Foundry Framework
This our Framework we've built on top of Foundry Core. It's a collection of tools, prefabs, scenes, templates, and utilities that we use to build our internal projects, and together with Foundry Core, it completes the Foundry SDK for Unity. 

This project is mostly Unity "front-end" implementation of Foundry. Foundry Core is a prerequisite
